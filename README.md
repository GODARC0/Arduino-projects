# Arduino-projects
projects based on Arduino


# ⚡ Arduino Playground  

Welcome to my **Arduino Projects Repository** – a place where ideas, wires, sensors, and way too many jumper cables come together.  
Think of it as my personal lab notebook… but with fewer coffee stains and more working code.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here  
This repo is a growing collection of:  
- 🤖 **Robots** that (hopefully) follow orders better than I do.  
- 🌡️ **Sensor Experiments** – from temperature tracking to motion detection.  
- 💡 **Automation Hacks** – little scripts that make life easier (or at least more fun).  
- 🎮 **Fun Builds** – random “can I make this work?” projects.  

Basically, if it runs on an Arduino and makes me say *“oh that’s cool”*, it goes here.
